# Project 2 
### Project Title: 
<p> Predicting ratings of Moisturizers at Sephora </p>

### Descripton: 
<p> The goal of this project is it to see if we can predict user ratings of moisturizers listed on Sephora's website. </p> 

### Features and Target Variables: 
<p> The target variable is the user rating for each product. The feature variables include the brand, the type of skin the product is intended for, the type of formulation of the product, cruelty-free product, vegan product, product has recyclable packaging, product is "Clean at Sephora", prize, and size in ounces. </p>

### Data Used (e.g., NYC Open Data): 
<p> The data used was scraped from Sephora's webpage. There was 500 moisturizes and I was able to scrape data for 400. </p>

### Tools Used (e.g., Scrapy, Seaborn, etc.): 
<p> Tools used included Python, Selenium, Beautiful Soup, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, JSON, Jupyter notebook, and Keynote.  </p>

### Possible impacts of your project: 
<p> The possible impacts include companies creating products using features that increase user ratings and potentially Sephora streamlining the webite to include only the information that the user finds important. </p>
